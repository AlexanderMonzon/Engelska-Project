                    importance to English culture as a whole. You can think of Canterbury as England's version of 
                    the Swedish island Gotland as it’s a medieval city that embraces its medieval culture. Canterbury 
                    has great shopping facilities, restaurants and cafés as well as many other different attraction 
                    sites but the most eye-catching one is definitely the Canterbury cathedral.

                    The Canterbury cathedral is a cultural monument for the city and the cathedral itself features 
                    remarkable architecture and offers tours for visitors as well as lodging for those considering 
                    staying overnight. It also offers itself as a location for weddings!
